# What's going on here?

I knew I wasn't going to be alone in this fight... and for that reason, I'm retiring this repo after just a day of usage.  
Don't worry, there's something so much bigger. I called it the Open Source Strikes Back organization, and I believe that this is how we'll influence change.

I'm enrolled in the organization, so if you wish to contribute to our side, feel free to contact me.
